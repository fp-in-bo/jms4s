There are different types of programs for consuming and/or producing, each of them is parameterized on the effect type (eg. IO). The data they consume/produce is kept as-is, thus the de/serialization is left to the user of the api (e.g. json, xml, text). Currently only javax.jms.TextMessage is supported, but we designed the api in order to easily support new message types as soon as we see demand or contributions. JmsTransactedConsumer: A consumer that supports local transactions, also producing messages to destinations. JmsAcknowledgerConsumer: A consumer that leaves the choice to acknowledge (or not to) message consumption to the user, also producing messages to destinations. JmsAutoAcknowledgerConsumer: A consumer that acknowledges message consumption automatically, also producing messages to destinations. JmsProducer: Producing messages to one or more destinations. Concurrency with JMS? The core of all JMS is the entity named JMSContext, introduced with JMS 2.0. The only safe way to scale things a bit is to create a “root” context (which will open a physical connection) and from that creating multiple other contexts. This library will keep a pool of contexts so that the user can scale up to pre-defined concurrency level."
